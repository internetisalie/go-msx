# Contributing

- Ensure you create a meaningfully named topic branch for your code:

  `feature/sql-transactions`

  `bugfix/populate-error-handling`

- Make your code changes

- Run `make precommit` to regenerate, reformat, license, etc.

- Commit your code to your topic branch

- Rebase your topic branch onto master (do not reverse merge master into your branch)

- Ensure your commits are cohesive, or just squash them

- Create a Pull Request with a meaningful title similar to your topic branch name
