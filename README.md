# go-msx

go-msx is a Go library for microservices and tools interacting with MSX. 

## Versioning

Currently this library and tools are in a pre-alpha state.  They are subject to
backwards-incompatible changes at *any* time.  After reaching the first stable release (v1.0.0),
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) will be used per industry and golang best practices.     

## Requirements

- Go 1.18+

    - Ensure your GOPATH is correctly set and referenced in your PATH.  For example:
        ```bash
        export GOPATH=~/go
        export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
        ```

    - Be sure to set your Go proxy settings correctly.  For example:
        ```bash
        go env -w GOPRIVATE=cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU
        ```

- Git SSH configuration for `cto-github.cisco.com`

    - Ensure you have a registered SSH key referenced in your `~/.ssh/config`:
    
        ```
        Host cto-github.cisco.com
              HostName cto-github.cisco.com
              User git
              IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
        ```
      
      Note that this key must be registered via the [Github UI](https://cto-github.cisco.com/settings/keys).

    - Ensure you have SSH protocol override for git HTTPS urls to our github in your `~/.gitconfig`:
    
      ```
      [url "ssh://git@cto-github.cisco.com/"]
              insteadOf = https://cto-github.cisco.com/
      ```

- Skel tool for code generation

    - Check out go-msx into your local workspace:
        
        ```bash
        mkdir -p $HOME/msx && cd $HOME/msx
        git clone git@cto-github.cisco.com:NFV-BU/go-msx.git
        cd go-msx
        go mod download
        ```

    - Install `skel`:
  
        ```bash
        make install-skel
        ```

## Quick Start

- To continue working on an existing go-msx project:

    - Return to the original project README instructions
      and continue.

- To add go-msx to an existing module-enabled go project:

    ```bash
    go get -u cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU/go-msx
    ```

- To create a new go-msx microservice skeleton project:
    
    ```bash
    cd $HOME/msx
    skel
    ```
